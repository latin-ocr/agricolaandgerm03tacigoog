eom. Instead of accepting a money-equivalcut for the ‘fru-
mentum imperatum,' they compelled the Britons ιο purchass
corn ircrn the Roman granaries up to the required amount. Oi
course they could fix their price, and had the purchasers at their
mercy. The corn would thus be often bought at an excessivo
price, and when bought it still remained in the Roman granariea
so that the whole affair was a ‘ludibrium’ Hence the Britcns
are said (r) ‘emere ultro frumenta' thatin, to buy corn need·
lessly and under very provoking circumstances, and (a) ‘ludere
pretic,' a phrase which has been variously interpreted, bnt which
seems ιο mean, ‘tc be going through a farce with the price,'
inasmuoh as they were paying deas· ior what aiter all the seller
kept in his possession. Wex's conjecture ‘luere’ ior ‘ludere’
which he explains by ‘luere imperata' ignores the ordinary
usage cf ‘luere' which requires to be followed by an accusative
of the object. In Livy, xxx. 37, the reading l‘pecunia luere’)
which he quotes is doubtful. Kritz reads ‘recludere’ and ex·
plains the passage as meaning that the Britons had to buy their
corn out citha grenones and then shut it up (i e. see it shut up)
again in them. But this use of ‘recludere’ is very questionable.
