4. Quod] Sc. which mode of fighting.

5. Imperio] The reading oi theVatioan MSS. endas
it seems, quite delensible. The idea is that 01 hand-tohand
fighting in a free open space, where the best and most convenient
weapons would be sure to teli. ‘In arcto’ (the reading adopted
by Ritter and Kritz) is a purely arbitrary conjecture. Livy,
xxxvm. 41, thus describes a similar engagement: etsi iniquo
loco, praelio tamen justo, acie operio, collatis armis perquandum
erat. The ground might he uneven; all that is meant is that
it was clear 01 obstaclee. Oomp. the Greek military phrase

7. connisus] ‘Straining every effort’ This iethe read·

8. Interim...haerebant.] This ia a sornewhat confused
sentence, about the reading and punctuation of which editors
vary. The question iswhether the ‘equitum turmae’ were those
01 the Romans or the Britons. Ii the former, we must either
read ‘ut iugere’ with Kritz, or take ‘fugere covinnarii’ with
Ritter, aa parentherioally introduced, which seems exoeedingly
awkward, and improbable. In this cese ‘equitum turmae’ would
no doubt be identical wilh the 3000 careby which, as appears
from Oh. 35, were posted on the wings 01 the Romam army. The
word ‘turmae' (a technical military term) would certainly seem
to point 10 a 11010011 rather than to any other force. It is, how-
ever, applied Aoo. nv. 34 10 the Britons (Britannorum copias

kinds 01 military lorce employed by them. Itis thus possible
that Orelli’s view 01 the passage (we have followed his punctua-
tion), taking ‘equitum turmae’ 10 mean the Caledoniam cavalry,
may be correct. Itis not satisfactory, but other explanatione
seem to involvo an alteration oi the text or a very harsh inter-
pretation. There can, we think, be no doubt that by ‘hostium’
in the succeeding clause is meant the Caledonians. vhe ‘covin-
uarii' (though they produced a sudden panio) soon became
entengled in the dense messes of their army’s infantry, and were
rendered useless by the unevenness 01 the ground.

0 Minimeque···impellerentur.l This is a corrupi pas·
sege which Orelli gives up. We have retained ‘equestris’ (aa the
vatican MSS. have ι001ιο111011), aedthen follow Kritnin reading
