xiv NOTES ΟΝ THE alre ΛΝΒ

Τ10 Dialogus de Oratore, which we have 00 hesita
tion in ascribing to the pen 01 Tacitus, was probably
an early work. The expression which we find in oh. 17,
“sextam jam felicis hujus principatus stationem qua
Vespasianus rem publicam iovet,” may not be intended
to do more than fix the date of the imaginary conver·
sation ; but the passage indicates a more favourable
opinion 01 110 Emperor than he seems 10 have enter-
tained in after years. (See Hirr. 11. 84, 111. 34, 10.)

The Agricola was published towards the close 01 l
nn. 973 the Geroeoay in the following year. The
Hialcry may with probability be ascribed 10 some year
between an. 103 and 106. Avery interesting letter 01
Pliny’s (Epist. rx. 27) very probably refers to it It
was still, we know, in course 01 preparation when his
Epistles vl. 1110 and vn. 33 were written The first
and second 01 11000 describe the famous eruption 01

which 10 was anxious 10 have recorded, “Auguror,''
he writes, “historias tuas immortales 10110005 quo
magis illis (ingenue fatebor) inseri cupio.” The publi·
oetion 01 110 Aauule must be referred, as 100 before
been said, to the close 01 Trajan's reign Referenoe is
made in Aua. xr. 11 10 110 H ietory 00 00 earlier work,

The two contained together thirty books, as we learn
from S. J crome on Zachariah, ch. 1111, and related the
events 01 about 70 years from the death 01 Augustus
to the accession 01 Nerva It 10 probable that Tacitus
