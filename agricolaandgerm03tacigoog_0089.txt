in meaning to alius, and it certainlyisunlikely that Tacitus would
even suggest a compar-ison between Cerialis and Agricola, as by
this interpretation he is made to do. For the expression ‘curam
famamque obruisset’ comp. (lh. 46, multos veterum oblivio obruit.
'Obruisset’ (would have completely extinguished) is a stronger
word than obscurasset, by which ithae been explained. By
‘molem' we are to understand the difficulty of the work imposed
on Frontinus, who had to complete what Cerialis had so ably
begua. Oomp. its use Aac. 1. 45, haud minor moles supererat
ob ferociam quintae et vicesimae legionis; frist. 111. 46, ne ex-
terna moles utrimque ingrueret. There remains some difficulty
about the words ‘quantum licebat? Their collocation seems to
require that they should be construed with ‘vir magnus,'
though Wex and Kritz take thern with ‘sustinuit molem,’ under·
standing them to mean that Frontinus, so lar as the difficulties
of his position permitted, carried out the arduous task which
devolved ou him, lt is possible however that Tacitus, although
in this very chapter he has admitted that under Vespasian there
were ‘magni duces,’ may be hinting at thatEmperor’s well-known
{carrucarum recessisses
that an imperial reginae is sure to set limite on greatness. Julius
Frontinus had been praetor urbanus. He was probably at tbis
time apraetorian legatus in Britain, and seems to have oom-
manded a legion in a different part oi the couu from that where
the operatione oi Cerialis had been conducte. He was the
author oi two works which have come down to us, one on mili·
tary stratagema, the other, on aqueducts. Pliny (ap. lv. 8, 3),
speaks oi him in high terms.
