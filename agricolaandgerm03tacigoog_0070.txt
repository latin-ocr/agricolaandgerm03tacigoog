Both grandfathers were probably Procurators under Augustus,
the father having been mede a Senator by Tiberius.

, 3· Quae equestris nobilitas est] There is nome
difficulty about these words. Wex considers them to be spurious

on the ground that really distinguished equites, such as are
called primores equitum (Huc. 1. 4) and equites dignitate senatoria

(Aac. xvl. 17), looked down upon the office of Procurator. In
support of uns view he quotes the latter passage which seems
to imply that Mela, who was an eques dignitate Senatoria, was
thought to have acted straugely when he accepted a Procurator·
ship ior the sake ol making a speedylortune. Kritz, on the other
haud, affirma that the office was bestowed only on the more dis-
tinguished members of the equestrium order. If the words are
genuine they must mean that tbe circumstance oi having one or
both grandfathers a Procurator constituted equestrian nobility.
The term ‘nobilis' was opposed to ‘novus homo‚' and meant
strictly a man whose father or ancestor had risen to a curule
magistracy. The dignity of a Procuratorship would constitute a
corresponding ‘ nobilitas' among the equites.
