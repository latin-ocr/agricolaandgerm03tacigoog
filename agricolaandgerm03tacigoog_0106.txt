mioniae-⁸ e word ‘aegra’ denotas the leebleness arising from
internal discord. Compita nse Hiat. 11„ 86, movere et quatere
quidquid nsquam neptum loret, adgrediuntur. (The Greek νοσεῖν
is used in precisely the same way. Sopb. In. 1070, rt μὲν ἐκ
δόμων νοσεῖ.) Oomp. also Claudian, Bell. Get. 437, vivusque oolor

racter oi ‘municipia’ that is, they bad their own ‘senatun’ and

tion oi tbe Roman ‘ veterani!
