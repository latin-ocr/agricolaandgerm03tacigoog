NOTES. 43 ·

8. Mutuum dissimulationem] ‘A mutual concealmons
of guilt’ <0 and Β). Comp. Hira. 1. 72, νίσω impenetratae, and
Plin. Epp.1x.13, Senatus severus in ostem senatoribus solis
dissimulationsqucsimutca parceret. ·

9. Subsidium] This possibly refers tc the advantage
whichacandidate derived from havin children. compieta. 11.
51, plerique nitebantur ut onmem l' in candidatis prac-
potore. This would be to carry cut the provisions of the lex
Papia Poppaea. We preferto give it a more general signification.

10. sublatum] ‘Bora' a phrase derived from the custom
by which a Roman father took up (sustulit) the child whom he
acknowledged, and wished to rear.

11. Brevi amisit] This does not necessarily mean what
Ritter understands hy it, that the son died before the daughter
was born. In that case we should rather have expected ‘ami-
serat’ The daughter was a ‘subsidium’ as increasing his family,
and when he lost his son became a ‘solatium’

ra. uibus inertia ...... fuit] Comp. Tacitus¹ account oi
Galba, iat. 1. 49, metus temporum obtentui fuit, ut quod

segedin erat sapientia vocaretur. In Agricola‘scase the ‘segnitia’
was oi course assumed.

13. TenoretsilentiumJ ‘Consistentquietude' (OandB);
‘tenor' is the correction of the MS. reading ‘certior'

14 Neque enim jurisdictio obvenerat] There were
twelve or more praetore, two of whom only, the praetor urbanus

and the praetor peregrinus, had judicial functione. Agricola did
not happen to hold either office. ’

15· Ludos et inania honoris· ..duriti ‘The gemes
and the pageantry of his office he ordered according to the mean'

(0 and B). It ie possible that ‘ducere’ may be equivalent to
. ‘edera’ with special reference tc the processioa, the notion oi
which would be included in the word ‘ludi' und which would be
expressed by the phrase ‘ducem pompam! It seems better, how·
ever, to connect ‘duxit’ closely with ‘medio‚' as ifTacitus meant
to say ‘he conducted them along the middle course? Ritter con-
siders it to be equivalent tc ‘arbitratus est,' but to make out
this view hc han to adopt the violent course oi substituting for
‘medio rationis* Lipsius* conjecture oi moderationis.

16. Famae propior] Sc. rather gaining distinction from
them than otherwise. Thcugh the exhibition was not prodigally
ostentatious, there was enough splendour about it to attract admi·
ration. Tacitus, it will be remembered was himself praetor, and
in that capacity presided over the Ludi Saeculares exhibited hy
Domitian, an. 88. See Ana. 11. 11, where he mentions this of
himself. ’
