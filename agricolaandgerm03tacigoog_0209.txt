64 CORNELII rrum annulum.

CHAPTER XXIX.
1. Harum] So. the tribes on the banks of the Rhine.

n. Non multum ex ripa] 'A small portion of the
bank) The words will not beer the meaning which some in·

terpreters have put on them, ‘not far from the bank)

3. Insulam Rheni amnis] Taoitus thus briefly de-
notes the island formed by the ubine, Vahal, aud Mosa. See

Hist. ιν. 12. It was known as ‘insula Batavorum)

4. In quibus...fierent,] ‘Whers it was destined they
should become‚' &n Compare Ayr. 34, Defixere aciem in his

vestigiis ιο quiden pulcram et spectabilem victoriam ederetis.
5· Antiquae societatis insigne] It seems fer-rennes

ιο refer ‘insigne' with Ritter to the ‘dextrae’ (clssped right
hands) mentioned Hirr. 1. 54, and 11. 8, as emblems of friendship
and good saith. The words find a more natural explanation in
the following sentence.

‚ 6· Namnet tributis-atterit] ‘1⁶03 neither ere they
msulted by trrbute‚ nor does the tax-gadrerer imposerrsh them.

⁷· Exempti oneribus et collationibus] ‘Onera‘nere
the fixed annual taxes ; ‘collationes’ special and extraordmary

contributione made after some great loss, such, for instance, as
we read of dnn. 1. 71, where we find that the provinces ot
Gaul, Spain and Italy, supplied the army ol Germanicus, which
had just returned from its campaign in Germany, with arms,
horses, money, &a Pliny (Poney. 41) praiees 'l'rajan for having
dispensed with these contributione, which were not always
voluntary‚ but were occasionally exacted. 'l'he Batavi are re·
presented as saying (Hist v. 25) that ‘not tribute, but valour
and bravo soldius, were required from them.' (Sibi non tributu
sed virtutem et viros indici.)

8. Tantum...sepositi.] ‘Reserved only for the purposes
of fighting.¹ For the word ‘sepositi' compare Ayr. 31, oeten-
damus quos sibi Caledonia viros seporwtt

9· Velut tela atque arma] comp. Hor xv, ια,
where the Bataviaresaid tofumish nothing to the Roman em·

pire but ‘ men and ornes?

ro. Mattiacorum gens] 'lhe Mattiaci were not neigh-
boure ol the Batavi, ss might be supposed from their being
mennoned in close connexion with them. Their settlements
were considerably to the south, on the German side of the
Rhine‚ and about Wiesbsdeu. lt appears from Her. Π. 3,
