to have regarded the Hercynian foreat as almost coextensive

with the southern part oi Germany. Tacitus is here speaking
cf ite western extremity. The locality which he assigns to the
Helvetii would thus nearly coincide with the duchy oi Baden.
It should be observed that by Helvetii he means those who had
qrritted their own settlements‚ and had established themselves
by conquesta on the German side of the Rhine. oi these move·
ments no particulare are known.

s. Ulteriora Boii] Parc oi tiis cibe coming to cae
sar, B. θ. Ι. 5, had croesed the Rhine and settled in Noricum,

perhaps in what is now a portion oi Bavaria and Bohemia.

of t eold traditione oi the spot,’ r. e. of its invasion and occu·

pation by the Boii.

ιο. Mutatis cultoribus] The Boii hed been expelles
by the Marcomanni (ees ch. 42, and Ana. 11. 62, 63) ander the

leadership of Maroboduus.

11. Ab Osis, Germanorum natione] Heio Tacitus
speaks doubtfully ar to whether the Osi were a German tribe.

Submquendy, ch. 43, he decides from their use of the Pannonian
language and the fact of their patient submission to tribute that
the could not beGermans. If we are determined that Tacitus
sh not be inconsistent with himself, we must understand the
words ‘Germanorum natione' to represent the nument conception
about the Osi, which cisseed them among the German tribes.
Ritter has ventured to substitute ‘natio’ ior ‘natione’ in order
to get over this difficulty.

sarim advantages and the same drawbeclrs.’ Understand by ‘utri-
usque ripae’ the right and left banks oi the Danube which were
occupied respectively by the Aravisci and Osi. The words ‘bona
malaque’ have their explanation in ‘inopia ac libertate.’ Nei-
ther tribe had any special inducement to cross from one side of
the Danube to the other.

¹3· Treveri] Gaesar, B. 0. vm. 25, describes the Tre·
veri as very lilre the Germane. It is singular that the Roman

general Cerialis in addressing them (Hist. iv. 75, 74) makes no
allusion to this supposed German origin, but rather speaks of

thern as Ganls whom Roman intervention had delivered from
German oppression.

¹4· Nervii] One oi the most powerful tribes of Belgio
Gaul. They were neighbours of the Treveri.
