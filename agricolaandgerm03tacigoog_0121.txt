14· Animo vultuque] 1eisn0eneeesssrytoexphinehis

as a hendiadis. ‘Animus' denotes the frume of mind which
inclines a person to the usual manifestatione of grief, ‘vultum’
its expression in the oonntenance. Domitian’s assumed grief,
showed itself not merely in his looks but in his general demean·
our. ·

r 5. Securus jam odii] ‘Being now carelees of hishatred.'
Domitian was now free from the anxiety with which his hatred
of Agricola bad filled him. Oonseqnently, being at cese in his
mind, he could, in spite of his natural irascibility, so far control
himself as to exhibit a show of sorrow. This he could not do as
long as he wes afraid.

16. coheredem] This probably implies that Agricola
made the emperor heir to half his estate.

17. PiissimaeJ A form disapproved by writers of the
Angustan ege. Cicero (Philip. xm. 19) twits M. Antonius with
having used it in reference to Lepidus.

18· Velut honore judicioque] ‘01⁶ was greatly prome)
as ifit were a compliment and a free choice.' Domitian in

this instance followed the example of such emperors as Caligula
and Nero, to the latter of whom Prasutagus, king of the Iceni,
and husband of Boadicea, paid the seme compliment with the
same hope asAgricols‚ SeeAwn.11v. 31. (lomp. also Ana. XVI.
11, where L. Vetus, one of Nero's victims, is advised magna ex
hitissshlffttit..ftttttttittttt debiti}
legecies from those who had children, would afterwards claim
a deceased person's estate on the slightest evidence. See Suet.
Dom. 9, 12. Pliny (Pomp. 43) speaks of the ‘security of our
wills’as one of the happy features of Trajan‘s reign. For ‘judicio'
comp. Suet. Oeten. 66, where it is said of Augustus, that, though
he refused to accept any legacy from strangere, amicorum tamen
suprema judicic morosissime pensitavit.

OHAPTER XLIV.

1. DecentiorJ ‘Decens’ denotes grace and symmetry of
figure. The Frencb translator Louandre thus rendere the pas·

sege ; Sa taille etnit bien proportionnde sane stre hante.

2· Nihil metue in vultu] So Oreni and Wex. Tho
MSS. vary. One has nihil metus et impetus, which can hardly

be the true reading, though Kritz adopts it. ‘Metus' here, as
elsewhere, denotes that which causes fear. Oomp. Quintillwstit.
VI. s, rr metum duplicem intelligi volo, quem patimur, et pacm
sanim. Possibly a contrast may be intended between Agricola
and Domitian whom Pliny (Pomp. 48) describes as ‘visu terribilis.'
