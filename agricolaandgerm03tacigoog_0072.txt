1· Prima castromm mdimenta.] ‘ms military appren-

tioeship' (0 and Β). ‘Castra’ is used ior ‘military service,' as
in ch. 16,·nullis cmtroram experimentis.

, a. Approbaviid So. so servedasto satiefy.

3. Suetonio Paulino] For Tacitus’ opinion oi this
general comp. Hie. 11. 25. cunctator natura, da, and 11. 31,

nemo illa tempestate rei militaris callidior habebatur.

. 4· Contubemio aestimaret] ‘contubernio aestimare’
is to form a jndgment of character by the opportunities of olose

companionship. The practice may be compared to the relation

in which in our service an aide-de-oamp stands to his general

officer. Comp. Sall. va. 64, in contubernio patris militabat,

Hist. 1. 23, contubernalem pellendo, where Otho wishes to make

lpismillitary1 ppdience feel tinet there is a tie of intimacy between
unse ι an em.

5· Neque Agricola ······ rettulit] The general meaning
is, that Agricola did not use the facilities afforded by his rank

either to procura enjoyment or escape from duty. His rank
(titulus) with one disposed to indulgence (ex ressed by licenter>
would have given opportunities ior pleasnre iioluptates). On the
other band, had he been idly disposed (expressed by segniter),
his inexperience (inscitia), τ’. e. the fact that be was of little use,
would have made it easy to get leave oi absence (commeatus).
‘Rettulit' may be rendered by ‘employed with a view t0‚' &o.;
‘referre ad aliquid' being equivalent to our expression ‘to
reler to an end;' comp. Plin. Epp. 1. an, nihil ad ostentationem,
omnia ad conscientiam reJ‘ert. For ‘commeatus' comp. Ana.
xv. ro, reliquas legiones promiscuis commatibus infirmaverat.

6.Ι Nihil appetere mactationem] ‘To attempt nothing
for display’ (0 and B); or more exaotly, perhaps, ‘to seek for no

ppzpppsearvevith a view to display;’ ‘appetere' being opposed to

7· Anxius ei intentus] ‘Oarefnl and vigilant' (0 and B);
or ‘careful and energetic? He was full of thought before the

time of action, and when the time was come wholly occupied
with what he was doing. ‘intentus' gives the idea of the full
tension of energy.

8. Excitatior] This is the conjecture of Buchner, which
we have followed Kritz in adopting instead oi ‘exercitatior’ It
means ‘more excited‚' and would seem tbe natural expression oi
Tacitus in speaking oi the native tribes3 eaercitatior· would apply
ratberto the Roman province.
