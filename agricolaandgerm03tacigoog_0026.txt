TO rHr LIFE OF AGRJOOLA. xxi

corrupt. Great critical acumen has been brought to
bear 011 it by Wex‚ who in the Prolegomena to his

edition, published 1852, has discussed the entire sub·
ject of the MSS. as well as every controverted passage

at great length. He thinks meanly of the recension

of Puteolanus in the 15th century, on which the
common reading of the text has from that time been

based. He relies chiefly on one of the Vatican MSS. f
of the loth century, the work of Pomponius Laetus

and containing on the margin the various readings of
another MS. which are written in the same hand.

Wex's examination of this MS. is subsequent to

that of Orelli and Baiter. Of recent editors he has

done the most for the Agricola. The moro recent
edition of Kritz mainly owes its velue to Wex.
