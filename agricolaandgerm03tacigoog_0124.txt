NOTES. 93

Rome. Tacitus, aa also Juvenal, Ν. 145, terme it ‘arn' to imply
that it was a kind oi ceutm aud stronghold of imperial tyranny.
Dio, nxvn. r, describes it as the emperor'a ἀκρόπολις. It was
here that he couvoked the ‘pontifices’ to pass sentence of death
on the Vestal, cornelia. See Pliu. Epa lv. 11. Not till the

the somewhat bold zeugma in the as it stands, reads

The zeugma seems not too harsh for Tacitus.

‘to sign one’s name under that of the plaintiff or accuser') is

continually used by the best writers as equivaleut to ‘accusare' ⁴ .

aad ‘indices' or ‘accusatores’ are also termed ‘ademptam’

make what has been heard the subject os a charge).

with a view to destruction the men whose faces are beginning to
turn pale; and the word ‘denotare ’ auswers to ‘designare,’ which
ie used in a similar way in OEc.0ot.1.1.2, notat et designat
oeulis ad caedem unumquemque nostrum. It seems clear that
‘denotare' may be thus understood, and therefore Wex's conjec-

ture, denotaudis...pallorc aeas (which, though probably Latin,
strikes us es awkward) is needless. With this passage may be
aptly compared J uveual‘s description of Domitian’s senate(1v. 74),
