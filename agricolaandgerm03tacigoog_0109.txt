’ 78 CORNELII raom AGRIOOLA.
a· Si pellerentur] Se. ‘reue auxitana were repulsae)

4· In speciem ac terrorem] So· with aview to an im· '

posiug appearance and to cause panic. ‘Species’ is used in a
similar way, ch. 25, [classis]...sequebatur egregia specie. ·

5. connexi] The MSS. fluctuate between connexi and
convexi. Oounsxi (the reading of Ritter aud Kritz) implies that
the line oi the Britons extended without a break up the slope of
the hill. Oonvexi, applied to this slopiug formation, might be
harah, but Kritz surely goes too iar in pronouncing it absurd.
The word, however, does not seem to be much wanted.

6. Media campi] Sc. the space between the two armies.

7. (lovinnarius eques] So thebert MSS. and the most
recent editors. The phrase must be simply equivalent to ‘covin-

narii,’ which word occurs in the following chapter. The word
‘covinnus,' according to Pomponius Mela (111. 6), denoted a
chariot armed with scythes. The Britons, it seemcd, horrowed
it from the Belgae. Caesar, B. θ. 1v. 24 (where he describes this
mode oi fighting), says nothing about the chariots having scythes,
nor does he use the words ‘covinnus,' ‘ covinnarii’ He speaks os
‘essedarii' (hy which he meant the same thing), and hs draws a
distinction between them and regular cavalry (equitatus), which
he says the Britous also employed. Tacitus makes no such direct
allusion to cavalry3 he merely tells us, ch. ra, that some tribes
genght with the chariot, among whom, it appears, were the Cale·
onrans.

8. Porretiior.] ‘Tooextended’

9· Promptior in spem] eomp. rann. ῃ, pravam
in pavorem. It. 61, promptum in adulationes mgemum.

spic. ‚Firmus adversis] ‘Resoluta under adverse circum
s ces.

11. Ante vexilla] By ‘vexilla' is meant the same asin
Gli. 18, contractis-legionum occillio, where see note ¹3· Agricola
took his stand in frent oi the peditum auxilia, mentioned above,
among which would be eevmal bodies oi troops, termed vexilla.

OHAPTER XXXVI.

1. Constantia] Sc. calm, seli-possessed com-aga

a. Cottia] 'ihs ‘cetra’ wasa small leathern nhield, like
the pelta. It appears from Livy xm. 36 that ‘cetrati’ and
‘peltastae’ were convertible terma.
