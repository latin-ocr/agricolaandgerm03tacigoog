WRITINGS OF remes xiii

August 23, an. 93. (See Agr. ch. 451 Itis certain,
however, that he was in Rome during the lest period cf
Domitian's reign. The language in which at the close
of the Aprieola he describes the horrore ot' that time is
full of the bitterness, and even of the aelf-reproech of
one who had been compelled to witness and to sanction
hy his presence the cruelties of the tyrant

Domitian was assassinated Sept 18, an. 95. Two
years afterwards Tacitus was advenoed to the dignity
of the Consulship. Verginius Rufus had died in his
year of effice, aud Tacitus was appointed to suceeed
him. He also delivered a funeral oration on his pre-
decessor. ‘¹‘ Hic supremus,'' seyr Pliny of Rufus
(Epist. 11. 1), “felicitati ejus cumulus accessit, laudator
eloquentissimus.”

In an. 100 he was appointed together with Pliny,
who was then Consul elect, to conduct¹ the impeach-
ment preferred hythe Province of Africa against their
lete Proconsnl, Marcus Priscus Pliny, who relates
the trial at length (Epist. Π. 11), describes his oratory
hythe epithet σεμνῶς. Here the public life of Tacitus
terminated We hear indeed in one of Pliny's letters
(vr. 9) of his interesting himself in the candidature of
one Julius Naso for some publio office. We may gu·
ther from the letter that he was not then living at
Rome, and, perhaps, as he was not aware that Naso
had started under the auspices of Pliny, that he knew
but little of what was going on in the capital.

The date of his death is not known, but that he at
least lived down to the end of Trajan's reign, we may
infer from Aac. 11. ¹61, where he says that the Reman
Empire ‘⁴ Nunc ad rubrum mere patescit,” en expres-

sion which must refer to the successes obtained by =

Trajan in his Eastern expedition (an. tlt-117).
