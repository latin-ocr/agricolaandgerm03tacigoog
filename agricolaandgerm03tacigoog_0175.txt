sinus and insularum spatia just mentioned, and may be ren·
dered, ‘where hare lately become known to us.‘

{³3 Quos bellum aperuit] cpmp. Art· 22² Tertius ex·
1 pedrtronnm annus novas gentes apernit.

9. Moneo flexa] Meaning ne bena which ne nnana
makes near Amheim.

Emmt' Versus] A participle, not a preposition as taken by
es 1.

rr. Molli] ‘Gentlysloping’ So Ritter, and Orelli who
compares Virg. Ee. 1x. 7, Qua se subducere colles Incipiunt
mollique jugum demittere clivo. This seems a more natural
meaning ior the word than that which Kritz gives it, ‘free from
rocks and with a fruithrl soil’

’ 12. Abnobae Jug0,] The reading Abnobae for Arnobae ·

or Arbonoe is conclusively established by inscriptions found in
the Black Pereat, and by a passage ci Avienus, a poet and
geographer who seems to have lived towards the end of the 4th
century, in his description oi the world, Abnoba mons Istro pater
est, eadit Abnobae hiatu Flumen, 437. ’

13. Donec...erumpat;] The subjunctive is commonly
used by Tacitus after dorice when the present tense is required.

It seems intended -to express the continuity ci a process as well
as rts termrnatrou.

CHAPTER 11.

1. Ipsos Germanos] The pronoun ‘ipre’ implies a con·
trast between the Genuam themselves and their country, which

issubsequently described. Comp. Ayr. 13, Ipsi Britanni.

a. Crediderim] ⁴1: am inclined to think.’ Tacitus gives
us three reasons lor believing the Germane to be indigenae ς (ι)
the difficulties presented by the ocean in the way ol emigrante,
tr) the unattractive character oi the country, (3) the native tra·
ditione oi the peopla

3· Adventibns et hospitiis] The first οἱ these worse
denotes strangam from distant countries; the second, persons ιιι

some way connected with the country which they visit.

4. Adversus] It is better, we think,to take this word
with Ritter in the sense of ‘hostile‘ than to suppose that
Tacitus was thinking of the Antipodes3 the preceding words,
