7· Spatia aa coelo, etc] ‘spatium’ means ‘extent’
ι00011101, ‘geographical position,' as astronomically and scienti·
lically determined. Thera is 'a reference to the division of the
earth ,1010 zonas. It 'seems that Tacitus (in common with other
writers) believed both Spain and Germany to extend much fur·
ther to the north than they actually do. On this supposition his
meaning in this sentence would be that Britain lies opposite 10
Spain on the west, to Germany on the east, and to Gaul on the
south; but that in the two former cases the distance is so con-
siderable that the fact has to be inferred from certain considera-
tions (expressed by the words spatio ac coelo), whereas in the casa
01 Gaul it was a matter 01 ocular- demonstration, Gallis etiarn
inspicitur. It will be remembered that Tacitus included Scandi-

' navia in what he'called Germany.

conception Tacitus had formed 01 the shape 01 Β111010, He

seems tc have shared the passion 101· discovering resemblances
common to the ancient geographers. lt has been doubted whe-
ther scatalo means a ‘dish,' or a mathematical figure; and,
taking the later supposition, whether it significa a rhombus, a
rhomboid‚ cr a trapezium. We incline 10 the latter opinion,
and may imagine the southern shore 10 be the longest side 01
the trapezium. The opposite or northern boundary would be
the shortest. This flgnre would bear some resemblance to the
bipennis, 11 we ⁸suppose the arca head only 01 that weapon 1ο be
intended. But 11010 this northern boundary, which one might
have supposed to be the extreme 111011 01 the country (extremo jam

like shape (10 cuneum). Excluding Caledonia (citra Caledoniam)

favour the reading ‘in universum,' which ths sense seems to ’

demand. Because this resemblance is real as to part 011110
island, it has been supposed to be so about the whole. ‘Uni-
,versia’ which Orelli reads, and which he interprete in this way,
can hardly bear such a meaning. Kritz reads ‘transgressis,'
which he takes to mean ‘among those who have crossed over
[irom the continent into Britain].’ This strikes us as 0 very
questionable rendering. ¹
