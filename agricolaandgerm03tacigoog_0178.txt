libus placant. ln Aac. 11. ιι, ιιι have mention oi a grove sacred
to Hercules. He seems to have represented among the Germane
abero rather than an actual god.

ι. Memorem] ‘Anthers tell us.' We should have apud
se instead oi apud eosif ‘Germani’ were the nominative to

5· Haec quoqne carmina] Haeo ts for cana or ejus-

Orelli reads ‘baritus’ aiter Grimm, who connects the word with
the Frisian ‘baria' (to raiae a shout). Dr Latham thinks that
Tacitus erroneously describes a German custom by a Gallio
name, but that he was perieotly aware of the differences between
'the Germanic and Gallie practice. Ritter brackets the words
(quem harditum vocant) believing them to have been added by
some reader imperiectly acquainted with the matter.

8. Ipso cantu] ‘From the mere sound of the song?

of walone! Orelli takes ‘concentus' to be the plural number.

This does not appear necessary.

produced the echo afterwards mentioned.
