strains too much aiter effect, hc is on the whole¹ a far

Ἴ It has been usual to regard Cicero as the repre·
sentative of the most perfect Latinity, and Tacitus as
a man ot' genius belonging to a declining age and in· -
fected by many of its chief litarary vices. Thia view
ignores several important considerations and requires
some correction. Itis true that the style of Cicero,
from iu general conformity to certain precise and
definite sulca, is fitted to be a model of Latinity in a
sense in which that of Tacitus cannot be. A modern

scholar feels instinctively that the first is much more
suitable for imitation, but it ia, we think, a great mis·
take to claim on this ground for Cicero a distinct supe-
riority over Tacitus. Cicero indeed was enabled by his
great abilities and wide culture to give a richness and
ilexibility to the Latin language which it had not
known before his time, and we may venture to affirm
that without him there could not have been a Tacitus.
If, however, we are to measure excellence of style by
its capacity of adequately representing the profound and
subtle ideas oi a really great thinker, we shall see good
reason for placing Tacitus in at least as high a rank as
Cicero. In vividness oi imagination, in insight into
the intricacies of human character, in the breadth and
comprehensiveness of his historioal faculty, he stands
first among Roman writers. These qualities are con·
tinually reflected in his style. In the language oi the
time, permeated as it was with Greek ideas and
phrases, he found an instrument ready to his hand;
he used it witha consummata mastery of its various

resourcea, and succeeded in giving to great thoughts a
singularly characteristic expression.
