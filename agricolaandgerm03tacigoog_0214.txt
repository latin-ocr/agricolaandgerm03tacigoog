1. Bructeri] 'lhe Bructeri were neighbours ol the Usipii,
with whom they are mentionedilrm. 1. 51. Ehem Aee. 1. 60, and
Strebo, m 1. 3, it eppeersthettherirerhuppie (Lippe) ran through
their territory. We heve no historical record oi the event alluded
to in the words ‘pulsis ac penitus excisis! It is not improbable
thet it may heve occurred efter the rebellion ol Civilis hed been
crushed by the Romans

2· Chemeros et Angriririosl rte cremavi ere
mentioned Arre 1111. 55, where it is seid thet their original
settlements were subsequently those of the Tubantes end Usipii
the Bructeri not being nemed. Atthis time the>⁷ appear to have
been settled on tbe benks ci the Weser. The Angrivarii, ee
‘may probably be inferred from Aen. 11. 19 and 41, occupied
districts between the Weeer and Elbe. Dr. Lethern suggests
thet the termination ol the neme is the ‘were' in Oantware end
:occupante inhabiteris.

3· consensu] ‘coertione ,,

¹ 4· Nam ne ······· invideres omp. Arta. 1. rr, Ne
hostes quidem sepulture arrideat. ‘spectaculo' is the ablative.

“They did not grudge or stint us even in tte spectecle oi the
battle. ’‘ We see the transition to this construction with the
ablative from the common usege oi the Augustam ege illustrated
by eie. De Oret. 11. 56, Nisi interdum in hoc Crasso paullum
inviderem. Quintilian, 1x. 3. 1, remerks that in his time the
ablativo wes used with inridere when Cicero would heve used the
accusative. We do not know to what particular event Tecitus
is here alluding. It must heve occurred between a. 1). 7ο and
98 (the date of this work) since irom several passages oi the
Historiae (lv. er. 61. 77, v. 18) it appears thet et the commence-
ment ol Vespasian's reign the Bructeri wereetill in existence.

5· Oblectetioni oculisque] Adstivus commodi. ine
expressionis a hendiedis. See note 17, cb. 28. Tecitus was

no doubt thinking of the pleesure which the Romam derived t
from the gladiatorial conteis

6· quande] ‘Since’

7· lingentibus imiiffi fatie] We retain Orelli’s reading
(which ss elso thet oi tter), es we see nothing gernod by the
irs urgentibus of Kritz, who interprets the words as equivalent
to si forte accidet ut letalia tempore instent. Tacitus seems
rather tc meen that ‘letalia tempore’ were even then looming,

notwithstanding the pramise oi prosperity given hythe com
