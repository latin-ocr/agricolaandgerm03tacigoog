and rank (aetate et dignitate propemodum aequatae?
The question is how far aequales must be considered
to be modified by propemodum We think the word
should be taken to imply a considerable difference.
Pliny himself says, “When I was a very young man
(adolescentulas) and you were attha height of your
fame and reputation‚ Ι earnestly desired to imitate
you” Adulescentulus is a very vagus term, but Pliny
may be taken to define this applicaticn of it to himself
when he tells us (Epist. v. 8) that he was in his nine·
teenth year when he began to speak in the Forum.
He was, as he tells us himself (Epist. vn 20), in his
eighteenth year when the famous eruption of Vesuvius
took place (a 1). 79), and he must therefore have been
born nn. 61 or 62. We are inclined to put the
date of the birth ol Tacitus at least ten years earlier.
. ln this conclusion we are supported by the passage
which we find in the third chapter of the life of
Agricola. There he speaks ol those who hed survived
the evil days of Domitian as coming under two
classes, the young men who had become old, theold
‘who had advanced tc the very vergo and end of
existence' He must have included himself in the
former class. The Agricola was published before the
death of Nerva but after the adoption of Trajan, ae.
in the latter part of the year 97. It may surprise us
that Tacitus could have spoken of himself as being
then an old man. But the term senior was technicelly
applied at Rome (Aul. Gellius, x. 28, quoting Tubero)
to those who had passed their forty-fit'th year. And
O. Cotta (in a speech to the people preserved to us in
one of the fragments of Sallust) speaks of himself, he
being then fortyeight, as an old man. If Tacitus

was lifty in mn. 97, he must have been born mn. 47 ς
