66 CORNELII TACITI CERMANIA.

cHAPruR XXX.

r. Chatti.) This tribe is wrongly described by Caesar,

B. 0. w. ι , as a branch of the Suevi.

a. Ul ahos] Ultra means further in a north-easterly

directior. It isaqueetion whether ‘hos' refers totheinhabit- ,
ants of the decumates agri (who are the last mentioned) orto .

theMattiaci. Ultra would have a much more precise meaning

in the latter case than in the former, as the settlements of the ¹

Chatti bordered on those nithe Mattiaci. They were further
from the Rhine, aud to the north of them. The passage from
Non numeraverim to the end ol ch. a bas the appearance cf a
parenthesis, so that it seems possible Curitis Kritz) to understand
‘hos' oi the Mattiaci, the last German tribe mentioned.

3. Non ita effusis...] We hare adbered in this passage
to the punctuation oi Orelli and Ritter. Kritz does not seem
tcmake it much clearerb beginning a new sentence at this
point, and taking effusis...lbcis as an ablativa which expresses
the cause of the Chatti continuing (durant) to dwell in their own
settlemente, and not migratingas some of the other tribes. Itis
better to take it simply as an ablativa of place, and to connect
it with the preceding. The following words, durant rarescunt
(which have been variously explained) appear to mean, ‘The
(the Chatti) extend, if (sc. whererer) the hill-tanges exten ,
and gradually diminish in number cs the country becomes kas
hilly.’ (Durant siquidem colles durant, paullatimque raresccm
siquidem colles rarescunt). An antithesis seems intended be}
twaen ‘durant' and ‘inchoant’ Louandre, as we think,
rightly, rendere durant by s'y prolongent· It is hardly neces·

many.

4· Chattos silos ······ deponit.) There is something bold
and poetic about this passage. The Hercyniam forest is person-

ified, and the Chatti are regarded as its ‘alumni’ ‘Deponit,'
‘laurea’ ‘sees the last of.'

5. Stricti.) “moechia” ‘sectans opposed tolenus,
solutus, flaccidus.

6· Ut inter Germanos] Sc ‘Considertng they cre

, Germaua' who ae a rule wore rash and impetuous.

7. Nosse ordines.) Understand by ‘ordines' ‘regular
military array! Comp. Ht'et. c 68, ordines sequi. The ‘son
lertia’ of the Chatti is illustrated entirely in reference tc war.
