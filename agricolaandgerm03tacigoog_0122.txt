His reason for so doing, that Agricola could not be pronounced
happy because his daughter and wile survivsd him and were thus
destined to see the evil days which he eacaped, seems far-fetched.
It must have been at least a comfort to him, aa pointed out in

11. Nam sicuti...0mins,batur,] Ritter's emendation ef
this passage (which he accomplishes by substituting quondam for

quod) appears to be the simplest, and we have (with Kritz) adopted
it. We think too Kritz is right in reading hanc lucem sor hac
luce, as this is the regular construction with durare. There is, it
must be admitted, considerable difficulty about the expression
‘durare amicabatur,' which may however be compared with a
passage in Hiat. 1. 50, erant qui Vespasianum et arma Orientis
appararentur. It may too be justified by the fact that sperare,
a similar word, is occasionally construe'd with the pressat inlini·
tive. According to Dio, nxrx. η (and Plin. Panep. 5, 94),
Trajan’s elevation was loreteld two years before Agricola’s death,
and to this Tacitus perhaps refers in ‘augenti' Or we may
render ‘Trajanum' by our expression ‘a Trajan) ‘Augurio
votisque ominabatur’ is equivaleut to ‘augurabatur et vehe-
menter optabat)
