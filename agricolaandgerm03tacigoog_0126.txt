7· Formamqne ab figuram] Fontem isthe correction

oi Muretus for somam, the reading of the MSS, and is accepted
by nearly all editors. comp. Oio. Tuae. 1. 16, 37, animorum
foratam ahpuam atque flpssrnrn quaerebant. Tacitus uses the
hrase to enote the whole mind and character of Agricola
i‘liny also uses it in connection with a very similar sentiment
(Pancy. 55), samara principis figuramque non aurum melius
vel argentum quam lavor hominum exprimat teneatque.

14. Obruit. 'lhis is Haupt’s emendation for obruet, the
reading ol the MSS. It has the merit ol bringing out more
foroibly the antithesis between ‘oblivio' aud the words ‘narratus
et traditus) The allusion in ‘multosveterum'is ιο the times of the
republic‚ and the general sentiment may be compared with the
well-known passage in Horace, 0. Ν. 9. 25, Vixere sortes aute
Agamemnona Multi; sed ornnes illacrimabiles Urguentur igno·
tique longa Nocte, carent quia vate sacro. Tacitus thus hints
more delicately at the effect oi his work than he would do by

describing it as ‘laudes immortales!
