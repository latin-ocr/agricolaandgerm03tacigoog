was intended to' be an appendix to the Histories‚ the
readers of which would perpetually feel themselves in
need of a fuller and more detailed acquaintance with
the country than could be conveniently given in the
course of the work. This is at least a moreprobable
hypothesis than many which have been suggested, and
which can be described only as groundless conjectures
If we are to have a theory on the subject, we incline
to think that ch. 38 which enumeratas the Roman
'losses in Germany and dwells on the fieres indepen-
dence of the people, more terrible even than Samnite,
Carthaginien, Gaul or Parthian, hints at the motiva
which led to the compositiones this work. A coun-
try so formidable, from which alone, as Tacitus might
well think, serious danger was to be apprehended by
Rome, would at least be worth a description as full
and as accurate as his opportunities enabled him to
give.

It cannot, we think, be inferred with any thing
like certainty from the contenis and general character
of this work that Tacitus had ever visited Germany
and passed some¹ time in the country. Kritz indeed
labours to show in an elaborate discussion that here
and there matters are described with a precision and
particularity which clearly betokcn an eye-witness,
and he lays considerable stress on the occasional intro-
duction of native words which he argues would hardly
have been known to one who had not actually resided
in the country. His arguments, though ingenious,
donet seem conclusive. It is certainly by no means
improbable that Tacitus may have been in Germany,
hut the various opportunities which he must have
had of gaining a knowledge oi the country are amply
