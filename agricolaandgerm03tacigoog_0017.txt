Paulinus (fyr. 5). chever this may be, itis oer-
tain that at or before this time an intimate acquaint-
ance had beon formed between the two men. In
ab. 77 Agricola returned to Rome to fulfil the duties
of the Consulship. During his year oi office ha
betrothed his daughter (born an. 65) to his young
friend. lucani miti, says Tacitus, filiam desporrdit.
Juvat, like other Iatin terma denoting age, is
clastic in its signification, but it is particularly appli-
cable to one who was between his twenty-fifth and
Ι thirtieth year. The marriage was celebrated in the
following year, the same in which Agricola assumed
his command in Britain.

The illustrious ailianae thus formed was probably
the means of introducing Tacitus to a career of publio
distinction. His elevatior, he says (licat. 1. l) was
“began by Vespasian, augmented by Titus, and still
further advanccd by Domitiau'' What offioes he may
have held under the first and second of these princes,
itis impossible to determine. Agricola himself was
Quaestor and Tribune of the People before he reached
the Praetorship. But the Quaestors were employed in
the Provincea If we suppose Tacitus to have re-
mained at Rome we may conjecture that he filled
the office of Aedilc, aad as Vespasiae, his first patron
died June 23, nn 79, that he was appointed to it
early in that year. His next office was probably that
of Tribune of the People, which, ns Titus died Sept 13,
A. n. 8l, he must have held either A. D. 80 or in the
following year. We know from his own testimony
(Aac. x1. ll) that he was Praetor au. 88, in which
year Domitian celebrated the Ludi Saeculares. In 89
or 90 he left Rome with his wife, and did not return
till after the death of Agricola, which took place
